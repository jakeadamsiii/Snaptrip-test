# Snaptrip-test

The test

1. Use the Google Places API to display equal sized responsive tourist information cards on a responsive web page (like our property cards on www.snaptrip.com/top-deals - but with tourism details) https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/search. Youâ€™ll need to sign up to Google Developers and get a places API key.

2. The cards should contain: Name, image, place/location, type of attraction, rating/number of reviews, distance from your location (this can be London if you wish) and website link. Use our property cards from search pages on Snaptrip for inspiration on your layout.

3. You should spend between 3-4hrs on this task. We're not expecting you to complete the task fully but it should function properly. It's more about your approach. We're looking for approach, tools used, JS APIs used and knowledge of SCSS/CSS3+. It should work across multiple modern browsers - desktop and mobile. You can also use any MVx JS library or just vanilla JS - please avoid libraries like Bootstrap and jQuery. You can however use components like grid systems or HTML boilerplates for the page setup.

4. Package your work up in a ZIP file and if possible host it somewhere too.
